# PrevNextInputAccessoryView

While creating my Hearts Scoreboard app, I sought to provide a means to navigate to the next text box in a way similar to the native iOS keyboard (pictured below).

I was surprised by the absence of documentation and examples to achieve this (or perhaps my Google-fu isnâ€™t up to snuff), so I thought it may be useful for other iOS developers to have a simple project to reference and achieve this functionality.

Below is a demo of the project in action.
